<!--    Object is a non-primitive datatype that give full information about data rather than array
--<><><>  Destructring in js   = is a way to unpack values from objects into varibales , to make the code cleaner and easier to read and also quick access to object properties
          let student = { name : "shivani", age: 19, city: "gurgaon" }

    destructring the object   ------***  
          let {name, age} = student ;
    
          console.log(name);     //shivani
          console.log(age);       //19



--<><><> Spread operator  =  (...) is used to "spread" the elements of an oject or array into another object and array
          let student1 = { name : "shivani", age: 19, city: "gurgaon" }
          let student2 = { name : "shivam", age: 20, city: "delhi" }
          
          const combined = {...student1, ...student2};
          console.log(combined)         // output = {name: 'shivam', age: 20, city: 'delhi'}
